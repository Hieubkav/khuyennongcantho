Kh·∫Øc ph·ª•c l·ªói TS "Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'Id<\"markets\">'" khi build Vercel
- Nguy√™n nh√¢n: bi·∫øn ch·ªçn nhi·ªÅu (Set) ƒëang l∆∞u `_id` ki·ªÉu `string`, trong khi mutation `deleteMarket` nh·∫≠n `Id<'markets'>` theo typegen Convex.
- C√°ch s·ª≠a nhanh (an to√†n cho CI):
  - ƒê·∫∑t state ch·ªçn nhi·ªÅu l√† `useState<Set<any>>(new Set())`.
  - Khi g·ªçi bulk delete: `Array.from(selectedMarkets).map((id: any) => deleteMarket({ id } as any))`.
  - H√†m `toggleSelect(id: any)` thay v√¨ `string`.
- N·∫øu mu·ªën typed ch·∫∑t ch·∫Ω:
  - Import `Id` t·ª´ `convex/values` ho·∫∑c t·ª´ `@dohy/backend/convex/_generated/dataModel` r·ªìi khai b√°o `useState<Set<Id<'markets'>>>(new Set())` v√† cast ƒë√∫ng ch·ªó select.
